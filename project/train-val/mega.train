on a more positive note nicola sturgeon once again breezed through a debate that's why we're proud of our first mini
didn't even know you still existed on here haha text me 626-430-8715
breaking news why are you supported by people who never see an immigrant !
just watching nigel farage on bbc 1 speaks what alot of us think.remember if you don't vote don't moan
there it is haha hope i don't got work tho bout to quit if i do
i'm interested in politics and history so i'm intrigued that someone with such an obviously foreign surname would support ukip
nigel is more prime ministerial then cameron miliband clegg put together !
ed miliband coming back to scotland tomorrow wonder if he'll end up cowering in st james centre hairdressers like durin
its sold out ( (
i'm not an snp supporter but i find your stance over them is nothing short of political blackmail and shows
do not retweet this i repeat do not retweet this david cameron would be most upset
only will tackle uncontrolled mass immigration and the effect on driving down wages
i don't know what happened
ukip support 50 50 shared parenting apparently
maybe if he was a bit more radical he would attract a few more votes down south
scotland be warned - the snp sturgeon will re-run 1979 and let another tory govt into power
you have to hand it to him nigel farage can talk shame the actual actions of his party are shit
if you're ever short of a laugh ask an snp supporter what austerity means
friday's i no deal with snp ( via )
why beg us stay we are part of the union then refuse to work with us then ? if the people want the snp why not work with us ?
surely you're not that stupid ? all it takes is majority to against tory queen'sspeech snp already said they will
did david cameron really talk about all the shared sacrifice that we've been through over the last 5 years ? we ? he seems t
ed milliband you are the voice of the people ! hes the only one who acts genuinely human !
hi ! saw who u follow and thought u might like dark plz let us know what u think
that makes really distressing reading
tory cunt
it's raining here but i will make sure i get a picture of him soon
i took one
ed miliband said he'd rather miss out on becoming prime minister than make a deal with the snp on - what's your
mirror poll who came off best on leaders question time ? ed miliband - 62 % david cameron - 29 % nick clegg - 9 %
excellent performance by nigel farage there was more and more applause for him after every answer
bowling is always best with friends
not a fan of the use of loreen's euphoria being used as a backdrop to that awful brand / miliband interview though
who is that moronic communist presenting this debate with her left wing idiotic interjections ! ?
wanna skate but it's raining
i know think that was major step back tonight did you watch the last leg with paxman and sturgeon slot ?
ed miliband prefiero no ser primer ministro a pactar con el snp el laborista ha sido muy claro en la
then it might be hard to get into final fantasy then cause the newer ones are pish in comparison get the remastered 10 for ps4
! ! nuggets and fries ! ! (
lab still in lead in latest latest yougov sun poll but con up 1 lab 34 % = con 33 % + 1 ukip 14 % = ld 8 % - 1 grn 5 % - 1
me too
brienne meeting lsh im so
ed miliband s refusal to admit that the last labour government overspent could cost him dear
my phone isn't charging it's been at 1 % forever ) )
like where ?
you could say he will have egg on his face
watch ed miliband trips off the stage following question time leaders special
still nothing in it but good to see ukip sliding back a little
snp want to break up the uk its the only reason they exist divide destroy snps policy
the problem with scottish labour is that they think ordinary scots - including labour voters - hate the snp as much as t
the independent against the liberal democrats
financial times come out in support of tories claiming miliband is preoccupied w / inequality the man who wrote it
it amazes me that farage and brand are perceived as opposites and so anti-establishment when both are the status quo
the next british leader with an outstanding question to nigel farage best moment of the night
one year later and we haven't even met

the ft is backing the tories on an unrelated note here's a photo of ft leader writer jonathan ford ( next to boris )
best move he has made should have done it weeks ago.nobody should work with snp who's sole aim is destroy
mps that will actually represent their constituencies and not vanish into westminster for 5 years of expenses and junkets
bye bye scottish labour he admitted he'd let tories win to avoid snp deal

jo coburn is proving exactly why ukip is right to complain about bbc bias
turned on bbc one for question time to find a q a with nigel farage urgh bedtime
i hear a lot see a lot i just don t say anything !
why are the bbc slaughtering ukip ? but saying only good things about the conservatives etc
wrong the snp have stated - evaluate every proposal on the basis of 1 the benefit to scotland 2 the good of the people
the rich have children while the poor breed see also the tory's benefit cap as a way to starve poor kids
words of north of eng mp to his ca snp are further to left than us and will help keep our leadership under control -
labour will do a deal with snp make no mistake ! scotland will rule the uk !

7 things david cameron said on tonight's question time debate that weren't * quite * correct
look scotland vote labour or i'll set the tories on you just for the sake of it miliband to scots voters tonight goodby
this shows the tory charge against labour to be the big lie ; the lie told in 2010 and repeated tonight by cameron

people of scotland you heard him he'd rather give you another 5 years of tories than work with you wipe his party out
you are deluded done it to yourselves your answer to everything bad snp referendum bad snp you are pathetic
when my local snp candidate says independence would follow as the uk economy implodes could he care less about impact on
pretty sure ukip have other policies other than on immigration
as the labour party worked closely with tories for no vote ? ?
i am a confused brat
david cameron says he's hungrier than he was five years ago so are all of the people reliant on food banks
ukip - hoovering up the votes of the politically inept since 2015
